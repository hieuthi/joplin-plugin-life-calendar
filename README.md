The purpose of Life Calendar is to document the events in your life but there is nothing stopping you from using it for other purposes such as project management. The yaml-based syntax make it easy to export your data to other format so your time documenting will not be wasted.

## Usage
You need to create a fenced code with `life` as language to render the calendar. The example below should demostrate all the supported features. It is recommended to intend the events block with spaces as yalm parser is quite sensitive. You may have a parsing problem when typing with Joplin as it use tab for intending.
